# libdpf

An unfinished library for Distributed Point Function. The construction is from "Function Secret Sharing: Improvements and Extensions" from Boyle et al.

We implement the early termination. The next step is full domain evaluation.

AES-NI tools all from https://github.com/amaloz/libgarble.

Inspired by the discussion with Frank Wang of https://github.com/frankw2/libfss, their construction is more general, rather than specifically PIR-purpose one-bit implementation.
