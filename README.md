# libdpf

An unfinished library for Distributed Point Function. The construction is from "Function Secret Sharing: Improvements and Extensions" from Boyle et al.

We implement 2-party 1-bit DPF with early termination and full domain evaluation. The reason we only implement 1-bit is that such construction is already sufficient for PIR-read and/or PIR-write.

AES-NI tools all from https://github.com/amaloz/libgarble.

The project is inspired by the discussion with Frank Wang in https://github.com/frankw2/libfss, their construction is more general, rather than specifically PIR-purpose one-bit implementation. We also use their idea of fixed key (and public) cipher (with AES-NI) to accelarate and simplify the one-way function. For details, please check this paper in NSDI'17.

## How to install

Install cmake and libssl-dev. use "cmake ." to generate Makefile, and then make.

Note that our implementation strongly requires AES-NI. Please check whether the Flags in /proc/cpuinfo indicated "aes".

We consider the machine to be at least 64-bit.
